.map Files

A map file (name.map) describes the layout of a level and the location of the various game objects on it.  The format looks as follows:

NAME: Testing Level
LENGTH: 9
HEIGHT: 9
KEYS: 1

MAP:
*********
*1111111*
*1000001*
*1T0C001*
*100000D*
*10K0001*
*1000001*
*1111111*
***XX****%

(the % is EOF).

This format is very very fixed. Changes will have undefined, and probably extremely back consequences! You should probably use the above as a template, and modify it to create a new level.  The tiles are defined using chararacters.  The meanings are as follows:

* = wall
C = cat (the hero)
D = Dog
T = Treasure
K = Key
X = Gate
A digit is an empty floor tile.  The value of the digit is (default heat - 1).  In general, any tile next to a wall should have a 1, and otherwise the number should be 0.  Feel free to create quite complicated layouts of walls.  The AI is fairly competent, but not too competent, at tracking the cat.
